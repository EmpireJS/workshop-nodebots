*Materials for EmpireNode 2014 nodebots workshop*

Learn the basics of the johnny-five api, as a series of code challenges.

johnny-five is an api for working with Arduino and other rapid prototyping boards.

**You _don't_ need an Arduino for this workshop.**

The workshop will pose a challenge, and will test your code.

The low level code to talk to the Arduino is stubbed out.

**You _will_ be writing working, executable johnny-five code.**

Each of your solutions can be run directly as a node program.

Wire up an Arduino, connect the USB and you can see you solution run for real.
