Do you love the immediate gratification of firing up a coding project and it works? How about shiny, flashing things? We want to show that node is an all-purpose, fun tool by showing its potential with hardware. How? By bringing together those interested in node and hardware hacking, and giving them an open space to hack, collaborate, learn, and share their results with others. We've got an awesome crew of nodebots devs on-hand to make this an exciting challenge.


*Materials for EmpireNode 2014 nodebots workshop*

Learn the basics of the johnny-five api, as a series of code challenges.

johnny-five is an api for working with Arduino and other rapid prototyping boards.

**You _don't_ need an Arduino for this workshop.**

The workshop will pose a challenge, and will test your code.

The low level code to talk to the Arduino is stubbed out.

**You _will_ be writing working, executable johnny-five code.**

Each of your solutions can be run directly as a node program.

Wire up an Arduino, connect the USB and you can see you solution run for real.

## Preparations for this training
All attendees need to do this **prior** to attending EmpireNode:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)--this ships with npm too! This **must** be a 0.10.x stable release.
2. Install [node-gyp dependencies for your system](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation)
3. Install [johnny-five](https://www.npmjs.org/package/johnny-five)

### Materials
**Your laptop**  
Otherwise, we are providing the hardware kits! Feel free to bring stickers, glitter, or magic to add your own pizzazz.
